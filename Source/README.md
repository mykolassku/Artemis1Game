STORY:

The year is 2024, your are choosen to be an first astronaut to land on the moon after Apollo program was stopped in 1972.

Your are first mission of Artemis program to land in lunar south polar region.

Polar regions of the moon are dangerous because of the lack of light, dangerous surface features like sharp rocks, lava tubes and variuous size of craters. 
Because of the lack of light lunar poles are one of the coldest places in out solar system.


Your mission, Artemis 13 is to locate ice water rezervours that is supossed to be present in the lunar polar region but cant be seen from orbit because of the lack of light.. 

Your are the commander of the mission Artemis 13.

You reached lunar orbit, detached from command module and safely landed with a lander. . 

You and your crew left the lander and were traveling for 6 hours with a rover in the search for ice water...
 

Your rover's fuel cells exploded, you look around you and you see all of your crew are dead. 
You were only one who was wearing pressure suit at the time when fuel cells exploded and depressurized the cabin.
You lost signal with mission control in Houston because of the damaged radio equipment by the fuel cell blast in the rover.
Your rover is not functioning but it's good resource for salvaging materials.
Your lander has the ascent stage, which is the only way to getting back to earth...
You dont know how much time it will take to get back to lander.
You are wearing a space suit that can support you for 4.5 hours in the vacum of lunar surface without the resupply of water ice and baterries.
If you find water ice you can resupply your suit the with oxygen.
If you find batteries you can resupply your suit the with electrical power.
100 grams of water ice will result in 5 minutes of oxygen.
1 battery will result in 5 minutes of electrical power for heating your suit.
If you run out of water ice you will suffocate and die.
If you run out of electrical power you will freeze to death.

You have a space emergency handbook with crafting instructions for tools that will boost your survivability:
	Improved suit lighting system(increased chance of finding water ice). Items required: 3x tape, 2x plastic, 
	Improved CO2 filtering system(increases your suit's oxygen consumption efficiency 2x). Items required: 2x plastic , 1x tape, 2x wire
	Build a radio set to communicate with Houston. Items required: 3x salvaged metal 2x wire 1x magnet

Every second counts...

MISSION GOALS:
1. Get to the lander.
2. Collect water ice and batteries to keep your oxygen and power supply up.
4. Don't make dumb decisions.
